Keeping track of league standings
This will be script to looking at the different ranking styles for the Settlers of Catan League

 4-Player Games:
 First: 10 points
 Second: 4 points
 Third: 3 points
 Fourth: 2 points

 3-Player Games:
 First: 7 points
 Second: 3 points
 Third: 1 point

 We will play the season until the first player reaches 100 points.  
 We should also cap games played at 2 or 3 a week?

 Flow / Ideas
 1. Rob will update a spreadsheet on Google Drive
 2. Read the spreadsheet from the Google Drive (if updated run a cron script for this..i think)
 3. Add it to the Database
 4. Provide the update to date standings
 5. Projections...Descriptive Stats...Graphs?
 6. Create and send email to the league players
 Example of what Rob provided in the email
